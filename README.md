# Word Game

A tiny word puzzler.

Submit a word on behalf of a player. A word is accepted if its letters are
contained in the base string used to construct the game AND if it is in the
word list provided: wordlist.txt.

If the word is accepted and its score is high enough, the submission should
be added to the high score list. If there are multiple submissions with the
same score, all are accepted, BUT the first submission with that score
should rank higher.

A word can only appear ONCE in the high score list. If the word is already
present in the high score list the submission should be rejected.
